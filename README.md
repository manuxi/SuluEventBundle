This bundle was made based on [Sulu workshop](https://github.com/sulu/sulu-workshop). 
I made it to have the possibility to manage events in my projects. 

This bundle contains
- Several filters for Event Content Type
- Link Provider
- Sitemap Provider
- Handler for Trash Items
- Handler for Automation
- Possibility to assign a contact as author
- Twig Extension for resolving events / get a list of events
- Events for displaying Activities
- Search indexes
  - refresh whenever entity is changed
  - distinct between normal and draft
  and more...

The events and their meta information is translatable.

It contains an example twig template.

This bundle is still in development. Use at own risk ü§ûüèª

## üë©üèª‚Äçüè≠ Installation
Install the package with:
```console
composer require manuxi/sulu-event-bundle
```
If you're *not* using Symfony Flex, you'll also
need to add the bundle in your `config/bundles.php` file:
```php
return [
    //...
    Manuxi\SuluEventBundle\SuluEventBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```
Please add the following to your `routes_admin.yaml`:
```yaml
SuluEventBundle:
    resource: '@SuluEventBundle/Resources/config/routes_admin.yaml'
```
Don't forget fo add the index to your sulu_search.yaml:

add "events_published"!

"events_published" is the index of published, "events" the index of unpublished elements. Both indexes are searchable in admin.
```yaml
sulu_search:
    website:
        indexes:
            - events_published
            - ...
``` 
Last but not least the schema of the database needs to be updated.  

Some tables will be created (prefixed with app_):  
location, event, event_translation, event_seo, event_excerpt
(plus some ManyToMany relation tables).  

See the needed queries with `php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --dump-sql`.  
Update the schema by executing `php bin/console doctrine:schema:update --force`.  

Make sure you only process the bundles schema updates!

## üé£ Usage
First: Grant permissions for events. 
After page reload you should see the event item in the navigation. 
Start to create locations, then events.
Use smart_content property type to show a list of events, e.g.:
```xml
<property name="events" type="smart_content">
    <meta>
        <title lang="en">Events</title>
        <title lang="de">Veranstaltungen</title>
    </meta>
    <params>
        <param name="provider" value="events"/>
        <param name="max_per_page" value="5"/>
        <param name="page_parameter" value="page"/>
    </params>
</property>
```
Example of the corresponding twig template for the event list:
```html
{% for event in events %}
    <div class="col">
        <h2>
            {{ event.title }}
        </h2>
        <p>
            {{ event.startDate|format_datetime('full', 'none', locale=app.request.getLocale()) }}
            {% if endDate and startDate != endDate %}
                 - {{ event.endDate|format_datetime('full', 'none', locale=app.request.getLocale()) }}
            {% endif %}
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ event.summary|raw }}
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ event.text|raw }}
        </p>
        <p>
            {{ event.footer|raw }}
        </p>
        <p>
            <a class="btn btn-primary" href="{{ event.routePath }}" role="button">
                {{ "Read more..."|trans }} <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right"></i>
            </a>
        </p>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

Since the seo and excerpt tabs are available in the event editor, 
meta information can be provided like it's done as usual when rendering your pages. 

## üß∂ Configuration
This bundle contains settings for controlling the following tasks:
- Settings for single view - Toggle for header, default hero snippet and breadcrumbs
- Landing pages for breadcrumbs: this can be used to configure the intermediate pages for the breadcrumbs

## üë©‚Äçüç≥ Contributing
For the sake of simplicity this extension was kept small.
Please feel comfortable submitting issues or pull requests. As always I'd be glad to get your feedback to improve the extension :).
